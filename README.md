## 📌 Project Overview

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Builds a CNN with three convolutional layers
- Uses one-hot encoding for label classification
- Evaluates model performance and visualizes predictions

---

## 🚀 Features

- Normalizes and reshapes image data
- Implements a CNN with ReLU and softmax activations
- Trains using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss
- Evaluates test accuracy
- Displays prediction with matplotlib
